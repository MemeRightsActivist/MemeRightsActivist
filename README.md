- 👋 Hi, I’m @MemeRightsActivist
- 👀 I’m interested in designing Co-op based videogames for all
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Unity, and how to resist the urge to throw away my computer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much. I know that a lot of people are a lot more experienced than I am.
- 📫 How to reach me: Doesn't this site have a message system?
